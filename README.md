-Serverless-Web-Application-for-Student-Management-
This project demonstrates the implementation of a serverless web application for managing student data using AWS Lambda, Amazon S3, and Amazon DynamoDB. It showcases a scalable and cost-effective architecture where:

📦 Amazon S3 hosts the static frontend (HTML, CSS, JS)

⚙️ AWS Lambda handles backend logic and API calls

🗂️ Amazon DynamoDB stores and manages student records

The application supports core features such as student data retrieval, updates, and seamless user interaction — all within a fully serverless environment. This repository includes complete setup instructions and adheres to AWS best practices for cloud-native application development.
